  "description": "Full-Stack Developer, working on the design and construction of scalable business solutions. Mostly oriented to Web Technologies and the digitalization of businesses. I highlight having designed and implemented a web-service (a demonized Backend API application) in charge of acting as a bridge to connect a client's ERP Software with their new choice of electronic invoicing provider. Developed in Typescript and deployed as a single executable taking advantage of one of the latest cutting-edge features of NodeJS, I am talking about SEA (Single Executable Applications), it also had a dashboard developed in React. I was also in charge of developing several other Frontend projects (a results consultation portal for clinical laboratory patients, and a web application for inventory management and filling of gas cylinders, the latter used by important companies in the sector on the Caribbean coast)."
